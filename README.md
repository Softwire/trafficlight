trafficlight
============

Code to control the Jenkins build traffic lights

The traffic lights are controlled by a USB relay board from SainSmart: 
* http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0098YC3DQ/
* http://www.sainsmart.com/zen/documents/20-018-909/4%20channel%20USB%2012V%20relay%20document/

The board is based on the FT245R USB FIFO chip which handles the USB connection.
This repos might be a useful reference for anyone who needs to communicate with these chips over USB but can't find a worked example.
